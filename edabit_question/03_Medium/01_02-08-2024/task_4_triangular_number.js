/* 
Triangular Number Sequence
This Triangular Number Sequence is generated from a pattern of dots that form a triangle. The first 5 numbers of the sequence, or dots, are:

1,   3,      6,      10, 15   so on
*,   *,      *
    * *     * *
           * * *
           
This means that the first triangle has just one dot, the second one has three dots, the third one has 6 dots and so on.

Write a function that returns the number of dots when given its corresponding triangle number of the sequence.

Examples
triangle(1) âžž 1

triangle(6) âžž 21

triangle(215) âžž 23220
